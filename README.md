# PyPy traceviewer

This tool allows you to find out what assembly code is generated by PyPy's JIT.
It shows the Python bytecode, RPython IR and its corresponding assembly code.

## Example usage

Let's say we have the following simple Python code (stored in file: `add.py`):

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def main():
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(100000):
        tmp += add(i, i % 17) % 100000
    return tmp


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What assembly code does PyPy generate for the loop and method `add`? In order
to answer this question, we need to generate a PyPy trace log file:

```
PYPYLOG=jit:pypy.log pypy3 add.py
```

Next, we generate a static HTML file that allows us to see what's in the trace
log:

```
PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run ./pypy-traceview pypy.log
```

The default output file is `output.html`. You can open this HTML file in a
browser, and you will see the following:

The left panel shows one-line Python code snippets and the matching Python
bytecode. The middle panel shows RPython IR, and the right panel shows assembly
output. Clicking on a Python code snippet will jump to the matching RPython IR.
